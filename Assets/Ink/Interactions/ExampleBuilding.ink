Closed for today.
A note hangs below the closing sign:
If those gosh darn kids would keep their hands to themselves.
Earlier this week when I went to get some more apples to restock the shelf
they snuck up and stole all my eggs.
And that's not all of it.
Yesterday all the eggs were returned to the store again.
I had to spend most of the day cleaning so I'm taking the day off today.
If only I wouldn't have to keep them in line all the time...
-> END
